# dsh-superagent

> **Research prototype for reference only, not an official DeepSeek product.** This code grew out of our team's day-to-day development work, with much of the engineering done by coding agents. Treat it as research code, not production-ready software. It may still contain bugs, and its coding style and engineering practices may be inconsistent. Review and adapt it before using it in your own environment.
>
> We have adapted it for publication, so it is not identical to our internal version or the implementation described in *Exploring Super-agent Design: Towards a More Autonomous Agent System*. Some designs discussed in the article are directions for future development and are not implemented in this prototype.

> **About this fork.** This fork (`jiaoqsh/dsh-superagent-prototype`) holds an independent evaluation of the Super-agent
> design and this prototype, from concept to design to implementation: [research/superagent-evaluation.md](research/superagent-evaluation.md)
> (in Chinese). It adds a replay bench that drives the real Engine and Policy with a real model as the Router
> ([`bench/replay`](https://github.com/jiaoqsh/dsh-superagent-prototype/tree/bench/replay/bench/replay)), and fixes what it finds
> (for example [`fix/released-inputs`](https://github.com/jiaoqsh/dsh-superagent-prototype/tree/fix/released-inputs)).
> Findings and open questions are tracked as [Issues](https://github.com/jiaoqsh/dsh-superagent-prototype/issues).
> The upstream repository is [deepseek-ai/dsh-superagent-prototype](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/dsh-superagent-prototype).

dsh-superagent is a proactive coding agent for one GitHub repository, packaged as a bundle for [DeepSeek Harness](https://www.deepseek.com/en/harness/). It listens to GitHub and, optionally, Feishu. When someone allowed asks the agent for work, it opens a work item, works on it in its own agent session and directory, and answers in the original conversation, for example with a pull request. A web panel shows what needs a person.

It is also a way of working with an agent: **take as little human attention as possible, and give as much value as possible.** An agent that can act for a whole team can also waste a whole team's attention, so it acts only when asked or when a rule the team wrote allows it, and speaks only when someone must act or can use a result. [docs/000-philosophy.md](docs/000-philosophy.md) explains the principle and what it asks of the operator.

## Setup

Setup has many steps, so an agent does it with you. Ask your coding agent:

> Read SETUP.md in this repository and set up dsh-superagent with me.

It asks one short question at a time, shows the full plan once, and then installs and configures everything. [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) is what it follows.
